Darius Rap:
Stakeholder theory: capitalism is dependent on relationships
Corporate social responsibility (CSR)


General summary for starting the rap

Darius person - values the relationship between leaders of company and those who are stakeholders (internal and external - employees, stockholders, other officers, customers, competition)

Connor Person - Dr. Michael (Mike) PAMN -  thinks its all about him and is a narcissistic leader (jack welch good example) - thinks they are better than anyone

Video Outline:

Connor sick with fever. (pan to thermometer showing high gas prices)

Father (darius) lays connor to rest in his bed, tucks him in, tells him to sleep tight, not to let the bed bugs bite, and tells him to call for him if he needs anything

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPUpsb_L6Z4

*rap battle commences (supposedly in the fever dreams)*

START RAP HERE

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJWS8eyjvaY - the real slim shady

Connor:

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real R. Freeman please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Robert Edward Freeman please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here.

Darius:

Y'all act like you never seen a good leader before
Jaws all on the floor like Gandhi and Jesus just burst through the door
And started preaching their stuff more than before
There were other ideas, well listen here i got more
It's time you learn a little more about the stakeholder theory 
Connor:

He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?

And Dr. PAMN said, nothing, you idiots
Dr. PAMN’s wrong, he's only thinking about him
The workers union love R.Freeman

Connor:

"Chicka, chicka, chicka, R Freeman, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, talking bout importance
Of the employees, man I cant stand him
Darius:

Yeah I probably lose a little of  cash the way I’m leading
But no chance ill be Dr. Pamn and end up leaving
I value all the people who keep supporting business
Even those who don't control our financial limits

Connor:

"Dr. Pamn is really him, Pamn is really him"

Darius:

And if you’re lucky, you might just make a single friend
But as for me, I got plenty because I value my people
We’re all a community, like a church in a steeple
We come together to decide, we all on the same ride
To get the check and be happy, we all tryna provide
For our families, that's why we value each other
And love one another, even the people against us
Our competitors make it better, we learn from them too
Thats why we value them, and you should too
And if you feel like I feel, this is the way to go
Stakeholder theory is the real deal yo

I'm R. Freeman, yes, I'm the real Freman
All you other R. Freemans should just keep on dreamin
So won't the real R. Freeman please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm R. Freeman, yes, I'm the real Freman
All you other R. Freemans should just keep on dreamin'
So won't the real R. Freeman please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?


Connor:

R Freeman has to be all nice when he is leading
But I don’t, I think once and then I do
You think I care a bit about employees
All of them work for me, why would they ever scare me

Darius:

"But Pamn, what if you fail, wouldn't it be weird?"

Connor:

Why, so you can blame it all on me?
If I fail it’s because of a faulty employee
Man, R. Freeman better switch my seat
So I can teach his little pawns about how I succeed
And turn them over to the land of psychopathy
Then show them how it works

Darius:

"But what about my TEDtalk, listen to me"

Connor:

I should download the video to MP4
So I can laugh my ass off at it, then I’ll just ignore
I'm sick of you other leading styles
They’re losing you money, but my stacks go up for miles
And there's a billion people built like me
Who lead like me, who just don't give a damn like me
Who think like me, all about their own beauty
And they might be great, but not like me

'Cause I'm Mike Pamn, yes, I'm the real Dr.
All you other Mike Pamns are just off your rocker
So won't the real Dr. Pamn please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Mike Pamn, yes, I'm the real Dr.
All you other Mike Pamns are just off your rocker
So won't the real Dr. Pamn please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

*next song should be diving into each of our theories and concepts even more*

Connor:

Let me tell you all about
The theories that I am based around
Its all about me, Im the clear best
Better than the rest I’ll say it with my chest

The Dark triad, is what defines me
Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy
I know the way to lead, because I know it all
If you need help you know who to call

Cause I am a narcissist
Employees? Who cares unless they help me
I dont feel a thing unless, someone trys to cross me

I tell my employees, that they’re doing great
But only if it helps boost my pay rate
Manipulation, is my friend
Thats what Machiavelli said
Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
I just signed a big big check
It goes to me - that's what matters
I dont care if relationships shatter

Machiavelli said
Ill cheat by any means to get ahead
I will undercut and lie,
To get my way in life until I’m dead

solo*

I dont care when others fail
As long as i dont end up in jail
If they die, let it be
They probably didnt matter to me
Oh, my, my, oh, hell no
You dont matter to me, just go
If you cant make me any cash
Get out of here, hit the dash

I have pyschopathy
For you, Ill never feel a damn thing
If you get hurt, i guess thats sad,
But I will never feel real bad

*monologue by pamn*

*next song*

You know I like my CSR
Corporation led just right
Social responsibility no fight
And my employees stay up

instrument  break

I like to lead my team and consider their lives
Work environment is home
I always think of them as a whole team
And thats why we grow
The workplace has a lot to talk about
And relationships are built on the corporate ground

And a little bit of CSR
Corporation led just right
Social responsibility no fight
And my employees stay up
Workin while the sunrise
See the passion in my workers eyes
Feel the bond throughout the night
And feel a bosses love

Well everytime i get my paycheck, i donate the most
If I am fed, and rent is paid, I’ll give and i dont boast
Theres no reason for, me to hoard, when ive got all this dough
So if you agree with philanthropy
Raise your glasses for a toast

To a little bit of CSR
Corporation led just right
Social responsibility no fight
And my employees stay up
Workin while the sunrise
See the passion in my workers eye s
Feel the bond throughout the night
And feel a bosses love

Instrument break

I thank God for my work
My family and support
CSR until I die, all my workers stay up
We’re all on one big ride
We all want to survive, so we try to agree in life
And that why we love

a little bit of CSR
Corporation led just right
Social responsibility no fight
And my employees stay up
Workin while the sunrise
See the passion in my workers eyes - DONT GO HIGH
Feel the bond throughout the night
And feel a bosses love

Get a little bit of CSR
Corporation led just right
Social responsibility no fight
And my employees stay up
Workin while the sunrise
See the passion in my workers eyes - GO HIGH
Feel the bond throughout the night
And feel a bosses love

*new song, rap battle*

Connor:

Cut this nonsense, let's duke it out like real men.
No more of this tomfoolery dealing with singing little songs about ourselves.
We shall commence into the greatest of all battles; a battle so great it should never be attempted to be described by the mere language of humans.
A battle so great, it puts competitive paddle boarding to shame.
A battle of such immense power, only the greatest of our specimens can do it.

I’d describe it to you, but I’d rather just show you.
Yo, Pierre, you wanna come out here? - sound byte
*beat drops* with airhorns

Let me tell you all about, the best way to lead
My style is the best; it's the only way you need
Get the bread, get ahead, get your way in life
And if you get up in my way, i'll cut you like a knife

Pierre made the beat, but jetson is my dawg
But they both stay ahead, leading the way through the smog
No ones matter to me because i cant feel emotion
If you don't understand, then you didn't catch the notion
Lotion, smooth skin, puttin the fo in the potion
Bars so hard i think it caused a commotion
Dr. Pamn on the track, so much money it could buy the ocean
Narcissism and machiavellianism
My money gold, in the shape of a prism

I’m leading all the people under me to success
And if they dont like me then i wish them the best
Just kidding, no i dont at all
They dont matter, i say screw them all
They’re only pawns inside my game, call this a chess match
I’m the king they help me win, to get the next batch
Of dough, coming out the oven its hot y'know
Burning a hole in my pocket, got too much yknow?
Spend it all for just myself
I dont need nobody else
No benefits employee health
I stay drowning in my wealth
No hesitation
For recreation
I lead for me and no else

*beat scratch*

Darius:

Ayo turn this shit off 
Let me speak my mind,
You’re a terrible boss with no regard to employee satisfaction
Relationships and morality are key in business, it's pretty obvious that you lack both
You think you’re a prophet but you only care about your own profits
My bars will kill you, this battle will soon be over
Turn the beat back on

*beat resumes*

I’ve shown you my way,
Business can be profitable and still do good every day
My CSR philosophy is the way to go
Business can make a positive impact, let it show

Im leading all my people and i care about their life
I love them all dearly, just like i’d love my wife
If i ever get one, ill treat her like a queen
Just like my leading style, i'll never treat her mean

And even those people, who wish the worst of me
I take in their opinion to ensure my employees
That we are still the best, and value all perspectives
And in my interviews i even love on our prospectives

Even if they arent the right fit for the job
They still can teach me something, im not a little snob
Unlike Dr. Pamn who calls his workers little pawns
Over here my people got the brains and the brawns

We working here together tryna reach the same goal
And we are all so happy, we be burning like some coal
Fossil fuels are bad, but thats the truth in the world
We making that money all our jewelry is pearled

Employees love me, and I love them
Thats why my newest worker offered to hem
My pants that were too long, and i thank her
Thats why we are all happy, like we in the summer

Connor:

Summer? I like me the winter
Its icy and its cold, reminds me of a leader
Talking about myself dog
Hard to see in this room, hella fog

Coming after me that's a bold move dog
You think you better than me? Got a house in the hills dog
Coming after me gon get you killed dog
But thats not quaker like but you aint got them skills dog

I be leading people and im making hella cash
Car so fast you would think i hit the dash
I work everyday, and my people work more
Got em thinking I’m their mom, the way i give ‘em chores
My leadership styles sum you should adore
But dont cross me ill get violent talking about gore
Horror film at the workplace going crazy
No employees of mine ever acting lazy
They better grind to make that cash for the business
And if they fail, what happens? Aye thats none of your business

Keep it a buck, I aint got no friends around me son
But that dont matter, cause my beach condo in the sun
Olympic sprinter, going so fast when I run
So fast to get the cash, yeah im number one

 *** we need to run thru bank account and see where this leaves us in length, if it needs a little more, ill lay down a few more lines and we can finsih the song out***

The next section is going to be a “test of leadership”, then we break into our individual songs, 93 till infinity and wet dreamz, where the idea is you destroy me - we decide that the rap battle could not give a clear winner, so we go into our songs and then a “judge” decides that yours is better - then we come together to do our duet
*temp script*how to plac

Connor:

You know what Freeman, this nonsense has gotten us nowhere. We’ve been explaining ourselves but the real test of leadership lies in the application. The proof is in the pudding if you will.

Darius:

I was thinking the same thing, Pamn. As shitty of a leader as you are, I agree with you for once.

Connor:

*shocked he would say that* Woah woah woah, don’t get ahead of yourself. You don’t get to determine that. I say we bring in a third opinion. (Obama? Joe Biden?)

*cut to a scene with a judge*

We have gathered here today to decide who is truly the better leader. In the left corner, we have Dr. Michael “Mike” Pamn facing off against our right corner contender, Robert Edward Freeman.

Gentlemen, we’ve gathered here today to truly decide who the better leader is. Let’s have a clean fight, no low blows, but roasts are 100% acceptable.

Heres how this is going to work. I will illustrate a scenario for you; one that requires a leader with the highest of qualifications and personal characteristics to be successful. You will have a maximum of 4.5 seconds to decide what song you want to use and start freestyling over it.

In the end, the referee will decide who wins. Without further ado, let’s get ready. Here is your scenario:

Let’s start by setting the scene:

Imagine that you are a high school teacher, who used to play basketball back in high school. You were quite successful yourself, going on to play in college, and only failing to make it professional because of your knee injury. (tragic, really) As a history teacher, your exposure to the basketball team has been limited, but you’ve still followed the sport enough to know the rules well enough to support a team. Tragically, the head basketball coach has to have emergency surgery on her foot, the assistant coach just left on maternity leave, and the athletic trainer is in prison. Everyone else in the school doesn’t even know what basketball is,  as they’ve all taken a passion in competitive paddle boarding. The championship game is today, and you’re the last hope for the team as the fill-in coach. What is your game plan? Your time starts now! (4.5 seconds) 
*we can decide who goes first but this is where we go into the songs*

Darius:

Yo, whassup? This is Freeman
Of the stakeholder theory crew
I'm chillin' with my employees, my competitors
And my customers, you know they’re dope 
But right now, you know, we just want to talk about leading
Got my degrees from Duke and Washington University
And, um, I value my relationships 
But right now, yo, I’m going to educate you on leadership

Let me bring you back to the days of hoopin’,
Back in high school, i used to ball, going stupid
Jump shot ice cold, you know i led the team
Back in 69’, hook shot like kareem
Damn! Best leader that they ever seen
Team captain, working hard to reach the dream
Dreams of a championship
You know we got that chip
I had to lead, but you know i did it for the team ** 

Thats why i lead now better than you
Yeah i care about my people but that aint nothing new
They support me and i support them
Leadership style like a diamond or a gem
Thats shiny, hard to find but easy to see
Not much to talk about point a and point b

Let me break it down talk about the situation
Paddle boarding competition done swept the nation
But I’m a hooper, a real jump shooter
Would made the league but my knee was made of pewter
Thats a metal, nah it aint that strong
Got me teaching kids, whats right and wrong

Yeah, i know the difference - good and bad
But now i gotta lead the team, im going mad
I got it in the bag tho no sweat for real
You know i keep it chill from ‘51’ til

Yeah, this is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead from '51 'til
Uh-huh, This is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead ... from '51 'til

Ima break it down in two parts
The first one gonna make you feel a flutter in your heart
Talking all about that stakeholder theory	
Got Dr. Pamn feeling just a little weary

Other players feeling jealous cuz they dont get credit
For the team success, feeling all decrepit
I make sure everyone feels successful
And even if we lose, we not regretful
I gotta teach the players what its about
Win or lose, we’ll make it out
The journey and experience is what its about

I take advice from everyone i meet
Im learning, even from the other team
Make one mistake and then we move on
Learn from it, dont just dwell on that jawn
Keep it real we value anything
Thats why I listen up when i hear something
Knowledge to be gathered, from the opposition
And those I value, because we on a mission

We gotta win the game, gotta get the point
Even if we lose, we sure as hell wont disappoint
Learning as we go, valuing opinions
Stakeholders, others, anyone’s my minions
They teach me more, ill listen from
'51 'til infinity, this my lil kingdom

Ah, this is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead from '51 'til
(Yeah) this is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead '51 'til
This is how we lead '51 until
This is how we lead '51 'til

Break it down this parts about CSR
Home or workplace? Never know where you are
Thats how we keep it on the team
Full discretion
Like family, working hard in the practice session
We got the same goal in the end
We tryna get the ring
Cherry on top, ice cream, BING CHILLING

Same goal keeps us close, call it claustrophobic
Locked in on the goal, hyper focused
We all friends, nothing comes between us
Working hard together, man you really should of seen us

Coming, now everybody’s running
But we aint dr. pamn, no we not super cunning
Honesty and truth, building up trust
Practicing hard, yeah we knockin off the rust

We get into the game the nerves start flowing
But once i hear the ball bounce, they all start going
Away, taking me back to my playing days
Leading this all natural, calling all the plays
Working together no sweat, yeah it's coming easy
Cruising through the game, flying by, feeling breezy
3rd quarter now the times tickin down
But this, not the end, cus we run this town from now 'til infinity

Ahhh (yeah), this is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead from '51 'til (huh)
This is how we lead from '51 'til (yeah)
This is how we lead from '51 'til
Aww yeah, this is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead from '51 'til
Yeah, this is how we lead from '51 'til
This is how we lead from '51 'til

Fourth quarter turned to blow out you know we win
Got that championship, Freeman stay stuntin
But, but who's leadin’ around the land, you know?
Yo, who's leadin'? I think I know who's leadin'
Gandhi, you know he's leadin'
Yo, Jesus Christ, he gotta be leadin'
Mandela, you know he's leadin'
Ayo, man, my-my man MLK is leadin', man
Yo, Churchill, you know he's here leadin'
Yeah, my man Abe Lincoln, you know he gotta lead
Mother theresa and the pope are leadin'
Aye, my man Marius, yo, he's leadin’
Yeah, it's like that, yeah

Connor:

Alright my turn. Hit it DJ

Pamn
Pamn world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back man
Tell you how i was

Got me leading like
Man, top tier leader like its 12th grade
Carrying the whole squad
All the other teams were always saying oh god
We were a threat, but i lead in the team in all stats
Coach was loving, got me feeling like im all that
Captain cause im magnificent
Baller on the court, leading straight killing it
Think it got into my head, but what cant you see?
Baller on the court, the people love me
'Cause when they see the jumpshot splash, and the net fly back
Everybody in the crowd erupts
Feeling like the man, i think you understand
The way it feels when you turn up
I knew i was the boss, and that was all that mattered
I was the main man - subject of all the chatter
I had it good,  everyone was obsessed with me
But can you blame em? I was the real boss you see?
Damn

Cause I was leading like this before yo
My leadership its been legit yall know
Cause I was leading like this before yo
Im the boss, and i dont mind to show
Cause I  was leading like this before yo-o
Yeah I  was leading like this before yo
New coach, Ima win fosho
Im a tell yall how it go

I tell the kids that i was captain back in the day
They think that im frontin'
I said i would've went pro
They say im just stuntin'
Off to a rough start but we finna turn around
I tell em get on the line, listen for the sound
of , my whistle
Running fast like a missle
Got me angry - hot to the touch - hear the sizzle
Gotta get them ready for the game no time wasted
Championship/Chip so close that i can taste it
But now the players feeling all mad - thats too damn bad
Dedication - hardwork - good stuff
Saying that im going to hard - im just playing all my cards
Tell em all to suck it up - thats tough
The day before the game - tensions rising higher
Teams doing alright but their coach is on fire
Not stressing in my mind cuz i know we’ve got the spirit
Just ready for the crowds to say my name - cant wait to hear it

Yeah
Nah i aint ever did this before no
But im not tripping on it oh no
The players know how to win the game though
All thanks to me im like a pro yo
NahI ain't never did this before no-o
I ain't never did this before no
Straight to the point im the true goat yo
Game time lets go

First quarter and we coming out real strong looking like a team
Move the ball around yeah its feeling like a dream
Kids are doing great and the crowds going wild
Memories come rushing back from when i was a child
2nd quarter starts now and we got the lead up
Feeling really good, dreaming bout the cup
We got the lead at the half and im flexing
But the players getting hot say that im vexing
Saying that im too damn selfish but i dont really care
Im the only reason they can stay up
And then they all get mad   , and they all storm out
Said they not coming back, tough luck
What just happened?
My team just left, and now im out here all alone
Half the game is left but all my players went home
What am i supposed to do? Crowd in the bleachers
How do i explain to them that im a bad teacher
Damn

'Cause I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
I never once failed before yo
Nah I ain't never did this before no
Cause I ain't never did this before no-o
I never once failed before yo
I ain't never did this before no
I ain't never did this before no

Judge figure (tbd): Well, I think its safe to say we have a leader here. By complete and utter obliteration, Freeman has won it! Forever on shall he be crowned the ideal leader. The value of stakeholder theory and corporate social responsibility shall live on forever in the world. Any last words from either of you?

Connor:

Freeman, as much as it pains me to say this, you are right. Your leadership style is better. I got so caught up in myself that I forgot the importance of relationships. Can you forgive me?

Darius:

Pamn, forgiveness is something that is earned in my book. If you think you’ve got what it takes, you can prove it to me by joining me in a gesture.

*fades out, then comes back in to the duet*

When you just cant lead like you used to before
And you cant motivate employees
Will your job be secure and your mortgage be paid?
Will i still get to fly to LA?

Cause freeman you lead, better than me, it's not hard to see
Your employees love you, you treat them right till infinity
And I'm thinking 'bout how people hate on my leading quality
And i just cant seem to understand
Cause im the best i know it, why would they hate me?
Dont they know that im doctor pamnnnnnnn?

So freeman now
Teach me how to lead in your style
Take me back to the school like a juvenile
Show me how to treat people right
I'm thinking out loud
Freeman, you know how to lead for miles

Darius:

When my afro’s gone and my mustache fades
The employees will still know my name
When its time to retire and i cant lead the same way
My employees will still love me the same

Cause pamn you see im, robert e free till infinity
You need to learn how, to value CSR and community
Im talking bout how, relationships are key in the workplace
Trust me its all part of the plan
Keep on building trust, fuck prosperity
I just hope you'll understand

So Pamn Now
Follow me in my leading ways
Treat employees like family. Give them love
Then youll see why theyre loving me
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe you should learn to lead like me

Pamn comes in with a ripping solo

So everybody now
Lead like us and you'll find the way
Make the workplace like home everyday
Oh Pamn, do you finally see the way? (connor: i do)
We’re thinking out loud
Maybe, we know just the way to lead

Look at Pamn, he learned just how to succeed
So follow us we’ve got what you need
